The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets)

## Part I

Write a function which take a number argument and returns a Roman Numeral String.

For example:

1 --> I

10 --> X

7 --> VII

47 --> XLVII

684 --> DCLXXXIV

etc.

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

See this Roman Numerals Wiki page for further reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals

## Part II

Write a function to convert in the other direction, i.e. roman numeral to digits.
